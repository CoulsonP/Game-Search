## Usage
* Once the user opens the site they are shown multiple different games.
* The user can select any of games and a small modal pops up in the center of the screen.
* The modal shows short details about the game including the name, rating, what platforms its on, the release date, and a link to the subreddit.
* The subreddit link also shows the title of the top voted post.
* When the subreddit link is selected it will automatically change the page to the subreddit for that game chosen.
* The user can easily click off to the side of the modal or press the close button to return to the other games.
